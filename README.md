- My name is Rich, but I go by @triplerstats here.
- My background is in statistics (Master's from NC State, go Pack!) and mathematics/economics (Northeastern, go Huskies). Clearly I like schools with husky/wolf mascots.
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and statistics. I tend to work on side projects related to sports when I have some free time. Most of my side projects are different NFL analysis ideas that I have.
